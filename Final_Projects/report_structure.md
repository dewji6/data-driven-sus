Introduce the sustainability case or problem. Clearly state the **research problem**, **research question(s)**, and the motivation behind the study. Explain why the topic is relevant. 

### **1.1 Background**  
Provide context about the sustainability issue being analyzed. Include key statistics, previous studies, or policies that frame the problem.

### **1.2 Objectives**  
List the main objectives of the research.  (General and specific).

### **1.3 Research Question**  
Formulate the main research question and, if applicable, sub-questions.  

---

## **2. Theoretical Framework**  
Discuss the theoretical background related to the problem. Cite relevant research papers and studies using square brackets for references, e.g., [1]. Explain key concepts, terminologies, and any models that support the study. 

Example citations:
- The concept of circular economy has been widely studied in recent years, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing waste and increasing resource efficiency [[1](#ref1)].
- Prior research highlights the importance of integrating machine learning techniques in sustainability studies to optimize predictive models [[2](#ref2)].

## **3. Methodology**  
Explain the approach taken in conducting the study, including the data collection and processing methods.  

### **3.1 Data Collection**  
Describe the dataset used, including the source, structure, and any preprocessing steps. If applicable, include the dataset description in the **Appendix**.  

### **3.2 Data Analysis Methods**  
Explain the Python-based analysis performed, including the statistical or machine learning methods used. Reference specific libraries and functions where necessary.  

### **3.3 Limitations**  
Discuss any limitations in the data, methodology, or assumptions made in the analysis.  

---

## **4. Findings**  
Present the key results from the data analysis. Use tables, figures, and charts to illustrate findings. Ensure figures and tables are numbered and referenced within the text.  

Example:  
**Figure 1**: CO‚ÇÇ emissions over time in different regions.  

---

## **5. Discussion**  
Interpret the findings and relate them back to the research question. Discuss potential implications, trends, and how the results compare to prior research. Mention any surprising insights or contradictions found in the analysis.  

---

## **6. Conclusions**  
Summarize the key findings and their implications for sustainability. Suggest recommendations based on the analysis and propose future research directions.  

---

## **7. References**  
List all references cited in the report using the square bracket citation style. Follow a consistent reference format (e.g., IEEE or APA numbered format).  

Example:  
<a id="ref1"></a>[1] Author(s), "Title of the Paper," *Journal Name*, vol. X, no. Y, pp. Z-Z, Year.  
<a id="ref2"></a>[2] Author(s), "Another Study on Sustainability," *Conference Proceedings*, pp. A-B, Year.  


---

## **8. Appendix** *(if applicable)*  
Include additional materials such as:  
- Data description files  
- Jupyter Notebooks with the Python code used for analysis  
- Supplementary graphs or tables that support the main findings  

All supplementary materials should be stored in the **GitHub repository** alongside the report.  

---

### **GitHub Repository Structure**  
Students should organize their repository as follows:  

```
üìÇ Project-Title/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ README.md  # Short description of the project (Max 300 words)
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ Report.md  # The research report in Markdown format (5000 - 7000 words). Important, the references are not included in the word count. 
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ data/  # Raw and processed datasets
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ notebooks/  # Jupyter notebooks with code and analysis
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ figures/  # Plots, charts, and visualizations
```

---

### **Final Notes for Students**  
- Ensure the report is well-structured and free of grammatical errors.  
- Use **code blocks** in Markdown when referencing Python code snippets.    
- Follow a consistent reference style throughout the report.
- - Properly **cite all sources** to avoid plagiarism. If you directly copy and paste text from another study, use quotation marks (`" "`) and provide a reference. When summarizing or paraphrasing, you must still cite the original source. Academic integrity is essential in research.
